This is a basic setup and it's intended for making the initial application architecture process much
faster and easier.

2. Install what's needed: `npm install`
3. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env`. Change the values (if you want).
4. Run the application: `grunt nodemon` *

\* You should have [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) installed globally, if not then run: `npm install -g grunt`

#### Done

Visit [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) (Unless you changed the port in the `.env` file)
